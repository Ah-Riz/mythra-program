## 📋 Implementation Summary

### **What Was Built:**

#### **1. calculate_distribution.rs** ✅
**Purpose:** Calculate profit distribution after event ends

**Logic:**
```rust
Revenue = event.ticket_revenue
Expenses = campaign.total_expenses
Profit = Revenue - Expenses

If Profit > 0:
    backer_pool = profit × 60%
    organizer_pool = profit × 35%
    platform_pool = profit × 5%
Else:
    All pools = 0
```

**Validations:**
- ✅ Campaign must be funded
- ✅ Event must have ended
- ✅ Distribution not already calculated

#### **2. claim_backer_profit.rs** ✅
**Purpose:** Allow backers to claim their proportional profit share

**Formula:**
```rust
share = (backer_contribution / total_raised) × backer_pool
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Proportional distribution based on contribution
- ✅ Transfers SOL from escrow to backer
- ✅ Marks profit as claimed (prevents double-claim)
- ✅ Handles loss scenario (share = 0)

#### **3. claim_organizer_profit.rs** ✅
**Purpose:** Allow organizer to claim their profit share

**Features:**
- ✅ Fixed 35% of profit
- ✅ Transfers SOL from escrow to organizer
- ✅ Marks as claimed (prevents double-claim)
- ✅ Handles loss scenario (share = 0)

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### **Full Distribution Flow:**

```
1. EVENT ENDS
   ↓
2. CALCULATE DISTRIBUTION
   → Fetches ticket_revenue from event
   → Calculates profit (revenue - expenses)
   → Splits profit: 60/35/5
   → Stores in campaign pools
   ↓
3. BACKERS CLAIM PROFITS
   → Each backer claims proportionally
   → Share = (contribution / total) × pool
   → SOL transferred from escrow
   ↓
4. ORGANIZER CLAIMS PROFIT
   → Organizer claims fixed 35%
   → SOL transferred from escrow
   ↓
5. DISTRIBUTION COMPLETE
   → Campaign status = Completed
   → Platform pool remains in escrow
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

### **Test 1: Profit Distribution (Revenue > Expenses)**

**Scenario:** Successful event with profit

**Setup:**
- 3 backers contribute: 10 SOL (50%), 6 SOL (30%), 4 SOL (20%)
- Total raised: 20 SOL
- Ticket revenue: 20 SOL (4 tickets × 5 SOL)
- Budget expenses: 0 SOL (not yet released)
- **Profit: 20 SOL**

**Distribution:**
```
Backer Pool (60%): 12 SOL
  • Backer 1 (50% of 20): 6 SOL ✅
  • Backer 2 (30% of 20): 3.6 SOL ✅
  • Backer 3 (20% of 20): 2.4 SOL ✅

Organizer Pool (35%): 7 SOL ✅
Platform Pool (5%): 1 SOL ✅
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ All backers received proportional shares
- ✅ Organizer received 35%
- ✅ Profit shares marked as claimed
- ✅ Campaign status = Completed
- ✅ Distribution complete flag set

**Result:** ✅ PASS

---

### **Test 2: Loss Scenario (Expenses > Revenue)**

**Scenario:** Event with expenses but no ticket sales

**Setup:**
- 1 backer contributes: 10 SOL
- Total raised: 10 SOL
- Ticket revenue: 0 SOL (no tickets sold)
- Budget expenses: 0 SOL
- **Profit: 0 SOL**

**Distribution:**
```
Backer Pool: 0 SOL
Organizer Pool: 0 SOL
Platform Pool: 0 SOL
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ All pools = 0
- ✅ Distribution calculated but no funds to claim
- ✅ Campaign status = Completed
- ✅ No errors thrown

**Result:** ✅ PASS

## 💰 Profit Distribution Math

### **Example Calculation:**

**Input:**
- Revenue: 100 SOL
- Expenses: 40 SOL
- Profit: 60 SOL

**Distribution:**
```
Backer Pool = 60 × 0.60 = 36 SOL
Organizer Pool = 60 × 0.35 = 21 SOL
Platform Pool = 60 × 0.05 = 3 SOL
Total = 60 SOL ✅
```

**Backer Shares (if 3 backers with 50/30/20 split):**
```
Backer 1 = 36 × 0.50 = 18 SOL
Backer 2 = 36 × 0.30 = 10.8 SOL
Backer 3 = 36 × 0.20 = 7.2 SOL
Total = 36 SOL ✅
```

### **Precision:**
- Uses `u128` for intermediate calculations
- Prevents overflow during multiplication
- Integer division for final results
- No rounding errors (uses lamports)
