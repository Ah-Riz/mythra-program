## 💡 The Problem

Event organizers face critical challenges:
- **💰 Funding Uncertainty**: 43% of events fail due to insufficient upfront capital
- **🎫 Ticket Fraud**: $1B+ lost annually to counterfeit tickets globally
- **😤 Trust Issues**: Backers have no transparency on how funds are spent
- **💸 Unfair Profit Sharing**: Contributors rarely benefit from event success

Traditional platforms charge 10-20% fees while providing zero accountability to backers.

## ✨ Our Solution

**Mythra** combines **crowdfunding** with **NFT ticketing** on Solana, creating a transparent, community-driven event platform where:

- 🎯 **Backers become stakeholders**: Vote on budgets, share in profits
- 🔒 **Funds are escrowed**: Released only when milestones are approved
- 🎫 **Tickets are NFTs**: Fraud-proof, transferable, with built-in royalties
- 💎 **Transparent financials**: All transactions on-chain and verifiable
- ⚡ **Low fees (5%)**: 12x cheaper than Eventbrite, powered by Solana's speed

## 🌍 Why It Matters

**Market**: $85B ticketing + $13.9B crowdfunding market, $1B+ lost to fraud annually

**Impact**: 5% fees (vs 10-20% competitors) • Backers earn 60% profits • Full transparency • Fraud-proof NFT tickets

## 🎯 What It Does

**Organizers**: Create campaigns → Get funded → Submit budgets → Release milestones → Share profits

**Backers**: Fund events → Vote on budgets (proportional voting) → Track spending → Earn 60% profits

**Attendees**: Buy NFT tickets → Transfer securely → Check-in (QR/Ed25519) → Get refunds if needed
