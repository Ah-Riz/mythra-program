## 🔴 HIGH RISK ISSUES

### H-1: Potential Reentrancy in Profit Distribution

**Location:** `claim_backer_profit.rs`, `claim_organizer_profit.rs`

**Issue:**
The profit claiming functions perform state updates AFTER transferring funds:
```rust
// Line 70-72 in claim_backer_profit.rs
transfer(transfer_ctx, share)?;  // Transfer happens first

// Line 78
contribution.profit_claimed = true;  // State update happens after
```

**Risk:**
If a malicious program is used as the recipient, it could potentially re-enter before the `profit_claimed` flag is set, though Anchor's account constraints should prevent this.

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Use Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern:**
```rust
// Update state FIRST
contribution.profit_claimed = true;

// Then transfer
if share > 0 {
    transfer(transfer_ctx, share)?;
}
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Needs Fix

---

### H-2: Missing Balance Validation in Profit Claims

**Location:** `claim_backer_profit.rs:52-75`, `claim_organizer_profit.rs:43-65`

**Issue:**
The profit claiming functions don't verify that the escrow account has sufficient balance before attempting the transfer. They rely solely on the calculated amounts stored in the campaign state.

```rust
// No check that campaign_escrow actually has 'share' lamports
transfer(transfer_ctx, share)?;
```

**Risk:**
If there's a discrepancy between calculated profit and actual escrow balance (due to a bug or attack), claims could fail unexpectedly or drain the escrow incorrectly.

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Add balance validation:**
```rust
// Verify escrow has sufficient balance
let escrow_balance = ctx.accounts.campaign_escrow.lamports();
require!(
    escrow_balance >= share,
    EventError::InsufficientEscrowBalance
);

transfer(transfer_ctx, share)?;
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Needs Fix

---

## 🟠 MEDIUM RISK ISSUES

### M-1: Integer Division Precision Loss in Profit Distribution

**Location:** `calculate_distribution.rs:55-71`, `contribution.rs:61-76`

**Issue:**
The profit distribution uses integer division which can lead to rounding errors and "dust" being left in the escrow:

```rust
// Line 55-59 in calculate_distribution.rs
let backer_pool = profit
    .checked_mul(60)
    .ok_or(EventError::ArithmeticOverflow)?
    .checked_div(100)  // Integer division loses remainder
    .ok_or(EventError::ArithmeticOverflow)?;
```

**Example:**
- Profit = 1001 lamports
- Backer pool (60%) = 1001 * 60 / 100 = 600 (should be 600.6)
- Organizer pool (35%) = 1001 * 35 / 100 = 350 (should be 350.35)
- Platform pool (5%) = 1001 * 5 / 100 = 50 (should be 50.05)
- **Total distributed = 1000, Lost = 1 lamport**

**Risk:**
Over many distributions, small amounts of SOL could accumulate in escrow accounts with no way to recover them.

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Allocate remainder to one pool:**
```rust
let backer_pool = profit * 60 / 100;
let organizer_pool = profit * 35 / 100;
let platform_pool = profit * 5 / 100;

// Allocate remainder to backer pool
let remainder = profit - (backer_pool + organizer_pool + platform_pool);
let backer_pool = backer_pool + remainder;
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Should Fix

---

### M-2: No Maximum Contribution Limit

**Location:** `contribute.rs`

**Issue:**
There's no upper limit on how much a single contributor can contribute to a campaign.

```rust
// Line 32-35
require!(
    amount > 0,
    EventError::InvalidContributionAmount
);
// No maximum check
```

**Risk:**
- A single whale could dominate voting power (60/35/5 split becomes irrelevant)
- Centralization risk in governance
- Could be used to manipulate campaign outcomes

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Add maximum contribution limit:**
```rust
const MAX_CONTRIBUTION_PERCENT: u64 = 50; // 50% of goal

let max_contribution = campaign.funding_goal
    .checked_mul(MAX_CONTRIBUTION_PERCENT)
    .unwrap()
    .checked_div(100)
    .unwrap();

require!(
    amount <= max_contribution,
    EventError::ContributionTooLarge
);
```

**Status:** 💡 Consider for v2

---

### M-3: Missing Event Validation in Contribute

**Location:** `contribute.rs:11-74`

**Issue:**
The contribute function doesn't validate that the campaign's deadline is before the event start time. This validation only happens during campaign creation.

**Risk:**
If the event start time is modified after campaign creation, contributors might fund an event that starts before the campaign deadline.

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Add event validation:**
```rust
// Load event and verify deadline is before event start
let event = &ctx.accounts.event;
require!(
    campaign.deadline < event.start_ts,
    EventError::DeadlineAfterEventStart
);
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Should Fix

---

### M-4: Campaign Escrow Can Receive Direct Transfers

**Location:** All escrow PDAs

**Issue:**
The campaign escrow PDAs are `SystemAccount` which can receive direct SOL transfers from anyone. This could inflate the escrow balance and disrupt profit calculations.

**Risk:**
- Malicious actor sends SOL directly to escrow
- Escrow balance > (backer_pool + organizer_pool + platform_pool)
- SOL gets stuck with no way to withdraw

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Track expected balance and warn if mismatched:**
```rust
// In calculate_distribution
let expected_balance = campaign.total_raised + event.ticket_revenue;
let actual_balance = escrow.lamports();

if actual_balance > expected_balance {
    msg!("WARNING: Escrow balance exceeds expected amount by {} lamports", 
        actual_balance - expected_balance);
}
```

**Status:** 💡 Informational (Hard to prevent in Solana)

---

## 🔵 LOW RISK / INFORMATIONAL

### L-1: No Platform Fee Claim Function

**Issue:**
The 5% platform fee is calculated and stored in `campaign.platform_pool`, but there's no instruction to claim it.

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Add `claim_platform_profit` instruction**

**Status:** 💡 Feature Addition

---

### L-2: Missing Escrow Balance Reconciliation

**Issue:**
After all profits are claimed, there's no function to check if the escrow is empty or handle remaining dust.

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Add escrow reconciliation check:**
```rust
pub fn finalize_distribution(ctx: Context<FinalizeDistribution>) -> Result<()> {
    let campaign = &ctx.accounts.campaign;
    
    // Verify all claims are done
    require!(campaign.organizer_claimed, EventError::OrganizerNotClaimed);
    
    // Check escrow balance
    let remaining = ctx.accounts.campaign_escrow.lamports();
    if remaining > DUST_THRESHOLD {
        msg!("WARNING: {} lamports remaining in escrow", remaining);
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

**Status:** 💡 Nice to Have

---

### L-3: No Maximum Milestone Count

**Location:** `submit_budget.rs`

**Issue:**
Budget submissions don't enforce a maximum number of milestones, which could lead to very large account sizes.

**Recommendation:**
```rust
const MAX_MILESTONES: usize = 10;

require!(
    milestones.len() <= MAX_MILESTONES,
    EventError::TooManyMilestones
);
```

**Status:** 💡 Informational

---

### L-4: Contribution Counter Overflow

**Location:** `contribute.rs:59`

**Issue:**
```rust
campaign.total_contributors += 1;
```

Uses `u32` which could theoretically overflow after 4.3 billion contributors.

**Recommendation:**
```rust
campaign.total_contributors = campaign.total_contributors
    .checked_add(1)
    .ok_or(EventError::TooManyContributors)?;
```

**Status:** 💡 Extremely Unlikely

---

### L-5: Clock Dependency for Timestamps

**Issue:**
All time-dependent logic relies on `Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp` which can be manipulated by validators.

**Recommendation:**
- Use Solana's `last_block_hash` or slot numbers for critical time checks
- Or accept this as a known Solana limitation

**Status:** 💡 Solana Limitation

---

### L-6: No Event Cancellation Function

**Issue:**
If an event needs to be cancelled, there's no clear path to:
1. Stop ticket sales
2. Refund all tickets
3. Refund campaign contributions

**Recommendation:**
Add comprehensive cancellation flow with proper authorization.

**Status:** 💡 Feature Addition

---

## ✅ GOOD SECURITY PRACTICES FOUND

### 1. Arithmetic Overflow Protection ✅
```rust
// Good use of checked arithmetic
let backer_pool = profit
    .checked_mul(60)
    .ok_or(EventError::ArithmeticOverflow)?
    .checked_div(100)
    .ok_or(EventError::ArithmeticOverflow)?;
```

### 2. PDA Validation ✅
All PDAs are properly derived and validated using `seeds` and `bump` constraints.

### 3. Double-Claim Prevention ✅
```rust
// Proper flags to prevent double claiming
require!(!contribution.profit_claimed, EventError::ProfitAlreadyClaimed);
require!(!campaign.organizer_claimed, EventError::OrganizerAlreadyClaimed);
```

### 4. Authorization Checks ✅
```rust
// Good use of has_one constraints
#[account(
    has_one = organizer @ EventError::UnauthorizedClaim,
    has_one = campaign
)]
```

### 5. Status State Machine ✅
Campaign status transitions are well-defined and checked:
- Pending → Funded/Failed
- Funded → Completed

### 6. Comprehensive Error Handling ✅
69 specific error codes covering most edge cases.

### 7. Event Emission ✅
Good use of events for off-chain indexing:
```rust
emit!(CampaignFinalized { ... });
emit!(RefundClaimed { ... });
```

### 8. Input Validation ✅
Good validation of user inputs:
```rust
require!(amount > 0, EventError::InvalidContributionAmount);
require!(milestone_percentages == 10000, EventError::InvalidMilestonePercentages);
```
